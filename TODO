While looking through the blackdown mail list, it was obvious that some people
really want printer support.  Here is a chance to put it in themselves.

ParallelPort and CommPortIdentifier files are provided so you can start 
implementing right away without worrying about how automake works.  They are 
not written in stone.  If you want to do it differently feel free.
The good side is the stuff compiles as is.  

ParallelPort support.  Needs some code.
	./configure --enable-PRINTER will create a Makefile that uses it.
	The SerialPort code should help one get up to speed on implementing
	files:
		ParallelImp.c stubs + a copy of SerialImp.c
                      A  large fraction of the stubs are filled in now.
		ParallelImp.h
		LPRPort.java simular to RXTXPort.java + stubs.

CommPortIdentifier support. Needs some code.
	./configure --enable-RXTXIDENT will create a Makefile that uses it.
	Plenty of example code can be found in commapi/samples/porting
	Please dont send in Sun's code.  

	Only reason I can think of for implementing CommPortIdentifier is
	to get rid of the "Port In Use By Unknown Solaris Application"
	message.

	files:
		CommPortEnumerator.java  All stubs.
		CommPortIdentifier.java     "
		CpoList.java                "
		CpoListEntry.java           "
		LPRPort.java                "
		OwnershipEventThread.java   "
	
------------------
backwards compatibility for older linux systems.
------------------
non linux specific implementations
------------------
allow the library to catch sigint so it can shut down the port properly when
sent
------------------
Add more documentation.
