This is the INSTALL file for RXTX.  If while following the instructions you
find it unclear or incorrect please make a note and email the details to
jarvi@ezlink.com.  

This is a developers release.  Current focus is on linux-2.2.  Lots of work 
is required to port this to other OS's.

For the impatient:

   ./configure
# jdk-1.2 users may do ./configure --libpath=/usr/local/java/jre/lib/i386
# otherwise set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the dir the .so's are put in (/usr/local/lib
# by default)
   make
   make install


For the methodical:

1) REQUIRED SOFTWARE

    The following packages are used on the test system:

    autoconf-2.13
    automake-1.4
    libtool-1.2b
    make-3.76.1
    CommAPI from sun. (unix version not Win32)
    jdk 1.2 or 1.1.7

    RedHat users note that libtool is included in the distribution but not 
    installed by default.  It can be installed by placing disk 1 of the
    distribution in the drive and running these commands as root:

      # mount /mnt/cdrom
      # rpm --upgrade /mnt/cdrom/RPMS/libtool*

    Double check that java is in your PATH.  Life will be hell without it.
    'which java' (this is how we find CLASSPATH,JAVAINCLUDE, JAVANATINC)
   
2) CREATE THE BUILD DIRECTORY

    mkdir build; cd build 
    in the following examples we will assume that the build directory is
    in /...path.../rxtx-version/build

3) CREATING THE MAKEFILE
   
    from the build directory
    ../configure

    If you would rather use the JDK_HOME environment variable to determine the
    location of the JDK tree use...

    ../configure --enable-JDK_HOME

    with JDK_HOME set to something like JDK_HOME=/usr/local/jdk.  Configure
    will check for JDK_HOME if PATH fails.
   
    ../configure --help  for other options not documented here.  
      Especially people interested in things like async communication, 
      debugging information, ...  configure tries to keep the code simple
      for initial ports.  
  
    linux-2.2 glibc users can do 
	 ../configure --enable-FULL_EVENT
    and have full functionality of the package.  Event notification is very
    OS dependent.  Expect it to break on non linux systems at this point.

    If, for some reason, no makefile is generated please send bug reports to
    jarvi@ezlink.com.  You may be able to continue by installing the latest
    GNU make package and then running ./autogen.sh; ./configure.

    for cross-compiling see the file CROSSCOMPILE

    Win32 users:   The rxtx package has dropped win32 support.  Email 
                  jarvi@ezlink.com if you have an interest in developing it.

4) JAVA INCLUDE FILES

    These should all be handled properly except for people using the JDK rpms
    found in RedHat contrib.  

    Check to top of the Makefile to make sure we agree on the location of
    the include files that came with the jdk.  Specifically:

    JAVAINCLUDE =  -I /usr/local/java/include/
    JAVANATINC =  -I /usr/local/java/include/genunix
    also check the classpath
    CLASSPATH = ...
  
    if your trying to build rxtx for commapi support you will need to
    have comm.jar in your classpath.  The Makefile looks in the
    environmental variable COMM_JAR_PATH and adds that to the classpath
    so you don't have to edit the Makefile.

  example:  #set COMM_JAR_PATH=/usr/local/java/lib/comm.jar;export COMM_JAR_PATH

    I realize that automake can make life hard.  You edit the Makefile and
    automake regenerates it...  if the above paths (especially JAVANATINC)
    are pointing to the wrong place and you don't know how to work with the
    make files you may want to just add a symlink.


5) MAKING THE PACKAGE

    # NOTE!!  if you have problems with make grab a copy of gnu make.
    # ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/makefile-3.76.1.tar.gz
    # -r--r--r--   1 root     bin        631458 Sep 19 19:41 make-3.76.1.tar.gz
    # thanks Michael.Forte@Corp.Sun.COM

    Try using the makefile. 
        make
	optional: make install  (installs commapi support too)
	run the BlackBox, SerialDemo or Simple applications that come
        with the commapi package
    if no luck look through Makefile and send back comments please.

6)  Start hacking...

    See TODO for developer ideas.

    CVS information is now shipped with the package.  To obtain the latest
    developer version with cvs perform the following.

       1. install cvs
       2. in the rxtx directory type cvs login.
          there is no password.  hit return when prompted for one.
       3. type cvs update.
       4. if your interested in contributing please email jarvi@ezlink.com
          to obtain an account with write permission.
       5.  The latest development is held in the rxtx-devel module.

7) Where does everything go?

    > Sorry, but where do I must put the *.h and the "libSerial.so" ? The
    > "java/include" directory or "java/include/solaris" directory or
    > somewhere else ?  This is not include in your documentation.

    make install should handle this now.

9) If you found that the package did not work after all this its probably a
   bug.  Please follow the procedure in BUGS for reporting problems.  Known
   bugs are listed at the bottom of that file.
