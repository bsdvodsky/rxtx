This is the INSTALL file for RXTX.  

If while following the instructions you find it unclear or incorrect please 
make a note and email the details to jarvi@ezlink.com.  

This is a developers release.  Current focus is on linux-2.2.  Work 
is required to port this to other OS's.  There should be few problems
with linux serial communication at this time.  

For the impatient:

   cd rxtx-version
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure  --prefix=/usr
   make
   make install


For the methodical:

1) REQUIRED SOFTWARE

    The following packages are used on the test system:

    autoconf-2.13
    automake-1.4
    libtool-1.2b
    make-3.76.1
    jdk 1.2 or 1.1.7
	Preferably the native threads version of jdk. 
    CommAPI from sun. (unix version not Win32)
	- assuming you have java in /usr/local/java -

	With jdk 1.2 install the files like this.  
		/usr/local/java/jre/lib/ext/comm.jar
		/usr/local/java/jre/lib/javax.comm.properties
	You may want to put some of the demo jars that comm with commapi
	in the same directory as comm.jar.

	With jdk 1.1.* install the files like this.
		/usr/local/java/lib/comm.jar
		/usr/local/java/lib/javax.comm.properties
	javax.comm.properties contains one line:
		Driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver
	jkd 1.1.* does not search for comm.jar in  the above dir.  You will
	need to point your CLASSPATH to comm.jar after building.  Also, you
	will want to point your CLASSPATH to jcl.jar after building the package.

    RedHat users note that libtool is included in the distribution but not 
    installed by default.  It can be installed by placing disk 1 of the
    distribution in the drive and running these commands as root:

      # mount /mnt/cdrom
      # rpm --upgrade /mnt/cdrom/RPMS/libtool*

    Double check that java is in your PATH.  Life will be tough without it.
    'which java' (this is how we find CLASSPATH,JAVAINCLUDE, JAVANATINC)
   
2) CREATE THE BUILD DIRECTORY

    mkdir build; cd build 
    in the following examples we will assume that the build directory is
    in /...path.../rxtx-version/build

3) CREATING THE MAKEFILE
   
    from the build directory with java in your PATH
    ../configure --prefix=/usr

    If you would rather use the JDK_HOME environment variable to determine the
    location of the JDK tree use...

    ../configure --enable-JDK_HOME --prefix=/usr

    with JDK_HOME set to something like JDK_HOME=/usr/local/jdk.  Configure
    will check for JDK_HOME if PATH fails.
   
    ../configure --help  for other options not documented here.  
  
    linux-2.2 offers improved event notification over previous linux kernels.
    rxtx recognizes 2.2 during the configure process and takes advantage of
    these features. 

    If, for some reason, no Makefile is generated please send bug reports to
    jarvi@ezlink.com.  You may be able to continue by installing the latest
    GNU make package and then running ./autogen.sh; ./configure.

    Win32 users:   The rxtx package has dropped win32 support.  Email 
                  jarvi@ezlink.com if you have an interest in developing it.

4) JAVA INCLUDE FILES

    For linux users with current systems you can probably go to the next step.

    Check to top of the Makefile to make sure we agree on the location of
    the include files that came with the jdk.  Specifically:

    JAVAINCLUDE =  -I /usr/local/java/include/
    JAVANATINC =  -I /usr/local/java/include/genunix
    also check the classpath
    CLASSPATH = ...
  
    If your trying to build rxtx for commapi support you will need to
    have comm.jar in your classpath.  The Makefile looks in the
    environmental variable COMM_JAR_PATH and adds that to the classpath
    so you don't have to edit the Makefile.  

    Linux ppc users:  We have had reports that the jar files need to be unjared
    for the build to work.  If you figure out more concerning this, please let
    us know. 

  example:  #set COMM_JAR_PATH=/usr/local/java/lib/comm.jar;export COMM_JAR_PATH

    We realize that automake can make life hard.  You edit the Makefile and
    automake regenerates it...  if the above paths (especially JAVANATINC)
    are pointing to the wrong place and you don't know how to work with the
    make files you may want to just add a symlink.


5) MAKING THE PACKAGE

    # NOTE!!  if you have problems with make grab a copy of gnu make.
    # ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/ makefile-3.76.1.tar.gz
    # -r--r--r--   1 root     bin        631458 Sep 19 19:41 make-3.76.1.tar.gz
    # thanks Michael.Forte@Corp.Sun.COM

    Try using the makefile. 

        make

    if no luck look through Makefile and send back comments please.


6) Where does everything go?

    make install

    which does the folling.

	- assuming you have java in /usr/local/java -

    jdk-1.2 the files go in
	/usr/local/java/jre/lib/ext/jcl.jar and
	/usr/local/java/jre/lib/$(ARCH)/libSerial.so.
	on all but x86 machines $(ARCH) is void.  Send in what configure
	reports just before creating the makefile if you would like your
	ARCH recognized.  The package works fine without using ARCH.

	jdk-1.2 handles CLASSPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH... not further changes
	required.
	Remember to check /usr/local/java/jre/lib/javax.comm.properties.

    jdk-1.1.* the files go in 
	/usr/local/java/lib/jcl.jar and
	/usr/lib/libSerial.so.

	jdk-1.1 users remember to point your CLASSPATH to jcl.jar and comm.jar. 
	The libSerial.so is placed in /usr/lib so people dont have to
	change with their LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  This may offend some people.
	Remember to check /usr/local/java/lib/javax.comm.properties.

7) If you found that the package did not work after all this its probably a
   bug.  Please follow the procedure in BUGS for reporting problems.  Known
   bugs are listed at the bottom of that file. 

   Furthmore, information specific to CommAPI problems can be found in 
   CommAPI.  Examples of bad setups are given.


8)  Start hacking...

    See TODO for developer ideas.

    CVS information is now shipped with the package.  To obtain the latest
    developer version with cvs perform the following.

       1.  install cvs
       2.  in the rxtx directory type cvs login.
           there is no password.  hit return when prompted for one.
       3.  type cvs update.
       4.  if your interested in contributing please email jarvi@ezlink.com
           to obtain an account with write permission.
       5.  The latest development is held in the rxtx-devel module.
