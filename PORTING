This is a devel release.  Little or know effort has been put into porting.
the reduce code footprint should make porting easier though.  An effort has been
made to point out areas of concern to people porting by #if defined (__linux__)
in SerialImp.c/h.   RXTXCommDriver.java also contains port names which vary by
OS.

If you want to port rxtx to a new unix platform do the following.
*IMPORTANT* you will probably need gnu make.

0.  ./autogen.sh (you will need a compatible automake autoconf and libtool)
1.  configure   
2.  make 
3.  common problems include the following varibles in the Makefile
      JAVAINCLUDE
      JAVANATINC
      CLASSPATH

We will gladly help with any UNIX platform.  Send questions to
jarvi@ezlink.com.  New OS's usually require tweaks.

If its not compiling try backing out functionality until it compiles.

win32 support has been removed.  contact jarvi@ezlink.com if your interested
in developing win32 support.  We will gladly put win32 code back in if there is
developer interest.

For all unix flavors... If the package did not work out of the box please
see BUGS and send a comment.
