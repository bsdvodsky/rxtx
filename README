There are numerous possibilities for projects that involve serial communication.
Java is an excellent language for putting GUI apps together.  Well have fun.  
Send back stories. 

Copies of the latest RXTX will be on http://www.frii.com/~jarvi/rxtx/download
The primary source for information/support is http://www.frii.com/~jarvi/rxtx/.

This is a native lib for jdk 1.1.*/1.2.*.  If you find changes required
for different platforms or OS's please pass them back this way so we may share
it with others.  Credit will be given unless one specifically requests no 
credit.

We chopped rxtx out of my program and tried to put a small example together.  
There is plenty of room for configurability, safe guarding and error reporting.
If you have some time please contribute some improvements.

A note on hardware:

  With the DB25 use 2 (TX), 3 (RX) and 7 (GD) to connect to the device.
  With the DB9  use 2 (RX), 3 (TX) and 5 (GD) to connect to the device.

  You will need to hook up more than that for hardware flow control.

Which device should you use?

  Linux serial ports should use /dev/ttyS?
  specialx, cyclades and isdn4 linux have been reported to work.
  as many as 64 ports have worked at one time.
  Irix serial ports use ttyd? ttym? ttyf?
  
A note on JDK RPMS for linux users:  

   You will have to edit the Makefile if you use the rpms from the redhat/
   contrib.  The RPMS do not follow the sun 'standard layout.'  JAVAINCLUDE 
   and JAVANATINC in the make file will need to be pointed to the include files
   that can not be found during the build.   If you can live without the rpm 
   we suggest getting the tar archive from www.blackdown.org mirrors.

A note on Win32:  

   Get the Sun CommAPI if you want a plug-in solution.  The code is provided 
   for people that may have demanding needs and coding ability.  If you make
   improvements, please send the changes back so we can share them.

We are interested in sharing this code in hopes that a more versatile lib may
be developed and released with minimal restrictions.  Please send any patches 
back my way if you like.   

For bug reports please follow the directions in BUGS.  For installation help
see INSTALL.
