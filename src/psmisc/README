psmisc, version 18 
+ _hacks_ to get a lib Trent Jarvi trentjarvi@yahoo.com
  This is experimental work for rxtx. 
  try testing /dev/ttyS0 to see whats up.
==================

This package contains four little utilities that use the proc FS:

  fuser     identifies processes using files or sockets (similar to Sun's
	    or SGI's fuser)
  killall   kills processes by name, e.g. killall -HUP named
  pidof	    like killall, buts lists PIDs instead of killing processes
  pstree    shows the currently running processes as a tree

They should work with most recent kernels. Man pages are included.
