1.4.12 release of RXTX - GNU implementation of communication API for JAVA
was released today:
http://www.rxtx.org

MAC OS X specific notes:

System requirement:
OS:	MAC OS X 10.1
10.0.X users, (I didn't check it)
expand file RXTX.pkg.sit.hqx (MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker folder)
try to install RXTX binaries from MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/RXTX.pkg
and read AFTER INSTALLATION notes below

ProjectBuilder 1.1 (from 10.1 tools)
or
CodeWarrior 7

you should download SUN's comm api before start
http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/index.html
choose solaris version
follow download instructions
put comm.jar file into 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/ext folder

1. Download 1.4.12 package:
http://www.frii.com/~jarvi/rxtx/download/rxtx-1.4-12.tar.gz
2.expand it (you can use Stuffit expander or any appropriate unix tool)
3.go to MACOSX_IDE folder


  4.ProjectBuilder development
    goto folder PB
	expand file LibSerial.pbproj.sit.hqx
	open LibSerial.pbproj project
	choose libSerial.jnilib target
        build
	after build you will find jcl.jar and libSerial.jnilib files in 
build directory
	(if you can't found jcl.jar (unlikely) build jcl.jar target manually)

5. CodeWarrior
	open libSerial.mcp project
	goto jnilib target
	build
	after build you will find jcl.jar and libSerial.jnilib files in 
project's directory
	(if you can't found jcl.jar (unlikely) build java target manually)
	

INSTALLATION:
	MANUALLY:
		copy jcl.jar -> 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib/ext folder
		copy libSerial.jnilib -> /usr/lib/java
		create text file javax.comm.properties
		this file should contain only one line:
		Driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver
  		(you can found this file in folder:
	
	MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Home/lib)
		copy javax.comm.properties -> 
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home/lib folder
		use sudo command if it's necessary
	PackageMaker package:
		CodeWarrior developers: before starting creating installation 
package do following step:
			copy jcl.jar into 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/
Home/lib/ext
			copy libSerial.jnilib into 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install/usr/lib/java folder

		open file RXTX.pmsp
		fix absolute path to Install and Resources folder
		it should point to MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Install
		and MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Resources
		respectively
		create package - PACKAGE's NAME MUST BE RXTX.pkg
		(if you want to change Readme or Welcome messages you may edit
		files Readme.rtf or Welcome.rtf from 
MACOSX_IDE/ForPackageMaker/Resources folder)

AFTER INSTALLATION VERY IMPORTANT
	check existence of the folder /var/spool/uucp
	if you don't have it create it with command
	sudo mkdir /var/spool/uucp
	permissions should be: drwxrwxr-x
	if they are not do command
	sudo chmod 775 /var/spool/uucp

	YOU should be a member of the uucp group
	you can check it with command
		niutil -readprop / /groups/uucp users
	you should see your name in output of the niutil command
	if you don't do following:
		sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users <yourname>
			substitute  <yourname> with your user's name
			for example if your user name is peter:
				sudo niutil -appendprop / /groups/uucp users peter

	NOTES: RXTX.pkg should create uucp folder and insert your name  in 
uucp group automatically

THAT's IT!!!!!!!!!

put information about installing libtoolize tool for MAC OS X

install libtoolize utility (glibtoolize utility that Apple provides 
doesn't work)

so MAC OS X NEED:
autoconf 2.13
automake 1.4
libtool 1.4

./autogen.sh (this calls libtoolize and the above utilities)
./configure
sudo make install

works just fine

Maintainer's note:

	Jump for joy.  You can't imagine how many hours went into figuring out
	how to get this to work on Mac OS X.  Joseph and Dmitry worked very
	hard to make that happen.
