If a Headers directory turns up missing in CVS A tarball was included in
PB/LibSerial just in case.  It should be ok.

--------------------- Gnu Tool Builds -----------------------

If you are going to try building rxtx on Mac OS X, we recommend you use
rxtx 1.5.   1.4 would require substantial modification to the Makefile to
get the build to work.

Mac OS X has some issues with libtool at this time.  This makes building
rxtx much more difficult.

The current solution is to take an automatically generated Makefile and then
manually edit it.

One such Makefile is provided to help build rxtx.  The file will probably
need to be edited to match your system configuration.  If you would like to
add more information for other Mac OS X users please email

We are sorry the build process is not easier.  A great deal of effort was
put into trying to automate the builds without luck.
